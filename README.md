## ArcGIS Background

### Mapping and Area Planning:

I have experience in creating detailed maps to outline maintenance areas for landscaping, utilizing the most current aerial photos to ensure accuracy and up-to-date information.

### Data Integration and Visualization:

I've worked on projects where lintegrated address data from spreadsheets into maps. This allowed us to visually pinpoint and organize locations, enhancing our ability to plan and coordinate field operations effectively.

### Application Development for Field Use:

I built easy-to-use digital mapping tools that help field teams access and display geographical information on-the-go. These tools are particularly useful for our partners and vendors who need to access map-based information remotely.

### Analysis for Planning and Reporting:

Using mapping software, I've analyzed geographic areas to calculate properties like size and perimeter. This analysis has been crucial for planning purposes and has been presented to stakeholders through clear, informative visual presentations.


## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
